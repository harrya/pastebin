## Instructions to use

Go to https://main.d1cfcw0x41k4bz.amplifyapp.com, type in some text and click submit. You'll be redirected to a unique page with your text. Share the link and they'll see the text too. Links to non-existent text ids will show a 404 page.

Due to time constraints I didn't implement the 15 minutes requirement but imagine this could be done with a TTL attribute on the record.

## Stack

Stack: React and Python backend on AWS Amplify with DynamoDB.
